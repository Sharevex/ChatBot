# 🔥 AI Firewall with DDoS Detection (`firewall.py`)

`firewall.py` is an intelligent, AI-powered firewall system built in Python that uses a Random Forest machine learning model to detect and mitigate potential threats such as DDoS attacks. It is designed to enhance network security by identifying suspicious traffic patterns in real time.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ AI-based intrusion detection using Random Forest classifier  
- 🌐 Real-time DDoS attack detection and alerting  
- 📊 Traffic feature extraction and preprocessing  
- 🔒 Lightweight, script-based deployment  
- 📁 Easily extendable with new attack signatures or ML models

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- `scikit-learn` for Random Forest model  
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling  
- (Optional) `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for traffic visualization

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Parses network traffic/log data and extracts relevant features.

2. **Model Training (or Load Pretrained):**  
   Trains a Random Forest classifier on labeled traffic data or loads an existing model.

3. **Live Detection:**  
   Classifies new traffic as benign or malicious (e.g., DDoS) and flags threats.
